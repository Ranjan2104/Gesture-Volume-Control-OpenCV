# Gesture Volume Control-OpenCV
 Gesture Control to change the volume of a computer. We first look into hand tracking and then we will use the hand landmarks to find gesture of our hand to change the volume. This project is module based which means we will be using a previously created hand module which makes the hand tracking very easy.
